<h1>Dynamic scene segmentation using motion blur</h1>
<p>
Motion blur in a photograph is caused by fast-moving objects as well as camera motion. In a 3D scene, a stationary object close to the camera can cause the same blurring effect as a fast-moving object relatively far from the camera. While motion blur is normally considered as a nuisance, we exploit motion blur as a cue to confirm the presence of moving objects. Given a single non-uniform motion blurred image of a dynamic scene, we make use of the mattes of the foreground objects to compute the relative non-uniform blur induced on the object. Using the estimated blur corresponding to the background and the foreground objects (possibly at different depths in the scene), we develop a method to automatically segment moving objects.
