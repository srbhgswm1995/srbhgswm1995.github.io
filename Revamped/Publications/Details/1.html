<h1>Face Recognition</h1>
<p>
Existing methods for performing face recognition in the presence of blur are based on the convolution model and cannot handle non-uniform blurring situations that frequently arise from tilts and rotations in hand-held cameras. We propose two methodologies for face recognition in the presence of space-varying motion blur comprising of arbitrarily-shaped kernels. The first approach for recognizing faces across blur, lighting and pose is based on the result that the set of all images obtained from a face image in a given pose by non-uniform blurring and changing the illumination forms a bi-convex set. Pose variations are accounted for by synthesizing from the frontal gallery a face image that matches the pose of the probe. The second technique leverages the alpha matte of pixels that straddle the boundary between the probe face and the background for blur estimation, and is capable of handling expression variations and partial occlusion as well. The probe is modeled as a linear combination of nine blurred illumination basis images in the synthesized nonfrontal pose, plus a sparse occlusion. We also advocate a recognition metric that capitalizes on the sparsity of the occluded pixels. The performance of both our methods is extensively validated on synthetic as well as real face data.
